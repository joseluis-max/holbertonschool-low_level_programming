## About Holberton School

Holberton School is a project-based software engineering school that offers a comprehensive curriculum covering various aspects of software development. The school focuses on practical, hands-on learning, allowing students to gain real-world experience through projects and collaborations. Holberton School aims to produce well-rounded software engineers equipped with the skills and mindset necessary to thrive in the tech industry.

## Course Overview

The higher-level programming course at Holberton School is designed to introduce students to advanced programming concepts and languages commonly used in the industry. The course builds upon the foundational knowledge gained in earlier stages of the curriculum, providing students with a deeper understanding of programming paradigms, data structures, algorithms, and more.

Throughout the course, students engage in a variety of coding exercises, projects, and challenges to reinforce their learning and develop practical skills. The curriculum emphasizes problem-solving, critical thinking, and collaboration, helping students become proficient programmers capable of tackling complex software development tasks.

## Languages and Concepts Covered

The higher-level programming course at Holberton School covers the following languages and concepts:

- **Python**: Python is a versatile and powerful programming language known for its readability and ease of use. Students learn Python as their primary language during this course, exploring topics such as object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, modules, and more.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is a popular programming language used for web development. Students gain exposure to JavaScript, learning about its syntax, dynamic typing, event-driven programming, and client-side scripting.

- **SQL**: Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used for managing and manipulating databases. Students learn SQL to store, retrieve, and modify data in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

- **Web Stack**: Students gain a practical understanding of web development by exploring the web stack, including HTML, CSS, and frameworks like Flask or Express.js. They learn to build web applications, handle requests, and create dynamic web pages.

- **APIs**: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow software systems to communicate and interact with each other. Students learn how to work with APIs, integrate them into their applications, and consume data from external services.

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Students study various data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues) and algorithms (e.g., searching, sorting) to develop efficient and optimized solutions to programming problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/topics**: This directory contains subdirectories for each topic covered in the higher-level programming course. Each topic directory contains relevant study materials, code examples, and exercises to help students grasp the concepts effectively.

- **/projects**: This directory contains project assignments that students must complete to demonstrate their understanding and application of the learned concepts. Each project has its own directory, including project instructions, requirements, and any additional resources.

- **/exercises**: This directory houses smaller coding exercises that students can work on to reinforce their understanding of specific topics or concepts. The exercises are organized into subdirectories based on the corresponding topic.

- **/contributing**: This directory contains guidelines and instructions for contributing to the higher-level programming materials at Holberton School. Students and instructors can contribute new topics, exercises, projects, or improvements to the existing content.

- **README.md**: The main README file provides an overview of the repository, Holberton School, the course content, and how to navigate the repository.

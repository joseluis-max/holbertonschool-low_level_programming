# Search Algorithms

- **What is a search algorithm**

    Search algorithm is an algorithm which solves a search problem, work to retrieve information stored within some data structure or calculated in the search space of a problem domain.

- **What is a linear search**

    Linear search is a sequentially search , That mean that traverse every element of a collection of items.

    Each and every item is compared sequentially and returned if it matches the search element or keeps on continuing till the end of the collection data, more used in unsorted and unordened data.

- **What is a binary search**

    Binary search is a search that split the list for find the searched element comparing the middle index of  the split list for look if the search element can to be there or not.

    There are two implementation method:

  - Iterative method.
  - Recursive method.

  Always work with a sorted list, The first step is sorted the list.

- **What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs**

    If I am focus in space time complexity always is better binary search, except if my data list is small.

    Depend if I have sorted or unsorted data list and too if I have a more easy implementation.
